## Problem Statement
You work for a startup that makes an online presentation software. You have an event log that records every time a user inserted an image into a presentation. (One user can insert multiple images.) The event_log SQL table looks like this:

| user_id | event_date_time |
|---------|-----------------|
| 7494212 | 1535308430      |
| 7494212 | 1535308433      |
| 1475185 | 1535308444      |
| 6946725 | 1535308475      |
| 6946725 | 1535308476      |
| 6946725 | 1535308477      |

Write an SQL query to find out how many users inserted more than 1000 but less than 2000 images in their presentations!
