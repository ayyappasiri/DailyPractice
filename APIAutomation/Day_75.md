## Learning Goal
Running API tests on container

### Problem Statement
You need to run rest API tests on a docker container.

### Steps
- Automate any simple rest API (local or public)
- Start a docker container to rupport the framework you are using for automation like rest assured, postman or request etc.
- Run the tests on locally running container.

Note: We are not creating docker file. That exercise will be covered in another challenge.
