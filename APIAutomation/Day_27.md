## Problem Statement

You are developing an mobile application which needs to use Spotify Create playlist feature. Write a consumer driven contract tests for the same if your application's functionality is as follows:

1) Create a user profile ( this is part of your mobile app)
2) Create a spotify playlist ( your mobile app is a consumer of Spotify )
3) Share the playlist with your friends ( this is part of your mobile app)

Steps to follow:
1) Create a Spotify create playlist API blue print (you can mock the responses of actual api)
2) Create user profile creation API for your APP (mock API)
3) Create share playlist API for your APP (mock API)
4) Add consumer driven contract tests for the create playlist API

Note: Use any supported tool as needed(example postman, pact, KarateDSL etc).
