## Problem Statement

You are asked to perform a POC on selecting external data source for your web automation framework. You have decided to do a comparative analysis of using local excel vs Google sheet. Your POC should include the following:
1) Identify a sample test cases which needs multiple data sets for testing.
2) Design a data provider interface and add both the implementation (excel sheet and google sheet). User of your framework should have the flexibility to select any of those.
3) Identify the pros and cons of each approach.
4) Record time taken by each approach for the same set of data and test case.
5) Prepare a report to project your POC to the management.
