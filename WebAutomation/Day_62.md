Run tests on container

### Resources
- https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
- https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/docker-selenium#quick-start

### Steps to automate
1. Open any website on chrome browser
2. Add a simple validation

### Problem statement
- Run the above tests on a docker container running in local machine.

Note: This is a simple problem to apply the understanding of execution of tests on a docker container. We are going to cover more complex scenarios like cross browser testing, distributing testing among multiple containers etc in upcoming challenges.
