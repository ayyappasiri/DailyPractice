## Problem statement
We need to perform accessibility testing on https://www.amazon.in/ or https://www.amazon.com by performing the below scenario:

1. Open the web application as mentioned above
2. Search for a product 
3. Add the product to cart
4. Proceed to checkout

## Test #1
Interact with the site using only the keyboard. 

## Test #2
With High Contrast Mode turned on, interact with the site.

## Test #3
With images turned off from browser settings, test the following
- Does the content make sense?
- Does the content become harder to understand?
- Is any content now missing?
- Do any important controls disappear?

## Test #4
Click on the text labels related to the scenario and test the following:
- When you click on the label next to a text input or textarea, does the cursor go into the field?
- When you click on the label next to a radio button or checkbox does that select the adjacent option?
- When you click on the label next to a SELECT element, does that place focus on the SELECT?
