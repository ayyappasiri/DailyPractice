## Problem statement

You need to test a binary sorting algorithm developed by your team. Prepare a test plan covering the below points:
1) How are you going to measure the efficiency of the algorithm (both time and space complexity)?
2) Identify the different types of tests you are going to perform.
3) What kind of test data you many need? How are you going to generate the test data?
4) How are you going to ensure test coverage here?
5) If you need to automate the testing process, add automation strategy as well.
