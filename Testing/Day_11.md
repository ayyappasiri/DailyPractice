## Problem Statement
Every employee working in a organization receives at least 22 days of paid leaves. Additional days are provided according to the following criteria:

- Only employees younger than 18 or at least 60 years, or employees with at least 30 years of service will receive 5 extra days.
- Employees with at least 30 years of service and also employees of age 60 or more, receive 3 extra days, on top of possible additional days already given.
- If an employee has at least 15 but less than 30 years of service, 2 extra days are given. These 2 days are also provided for employees of age 45 or more. These 2 extra days can not be combined with the extra 5 days.

Create a decision table and identify the possible test cases for the above problem.
