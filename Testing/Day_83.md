## Learning Goal
Microservices Architecture Testing

### Problem Statement
You are responsible for testing an application which internally uses microservices architecture.

Source code - https://github.com/vmudigal/microservices-sample

Architecture diagram - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vmudigal/microservices-sample/version-5/documents/architecture/Infrastructure.png
Given this information how are you going to perform testing on this application:

### Hints
1) Identify the dependencies between the components.
2) Identify the potential risks in this system.
3) What are the different types of testing that you would suggest - both functional and non-
functional? 
4) What are different protocols between components that you can think of in the system
under test?
