## Learning Goal
Test status reporting

### Problem Statement
You are responsible for testing the application hosted at https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide. Assuming the different kinds of testing you are going to perform, create a Major release status report which will demonstrate the quality status to the stackholders. Your report should include atleast the following:
1) Epic and Userstories - status for the features planned (feature list can be picked from the application listed above). The following statuses can be used 
- Inprogress
- Inreview
- Intesting
- Blocked
- Done
3) Stories completion status as per DOD (in percentage)
4) Known/unknown risk if any
5) Defect status
6) Team velocity
7) Quality status including different types of testing performed.
8) Overall release status (go/no go)

Note: You can use needed assumptions on the numbers to showcast. The above list is for your reference, please add any other thing you would like to include in your report.
