## Learning Goal
Test status reporting

### Problem Statement
You are responsible for testing the application hosted at https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide. Assuming the different kinds of testing you are going to perform, create a Major release status report which will demonstrate the quality status to the stackholders. Your report should include atleast the following:
1) Epic and Userstories - status for the features planned (feature list can be picked from the application listed above)
2) Stories completion status as per DOD
3) Defect status
4) Status as per different types of testing performed.
5) Overall release status (go/no go)

Note: You can use needed assumptions on the numbers to showcast. The above list is for your reference, please add any other thing you would like to include in your report.
