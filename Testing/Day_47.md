## Learning Goal

### Problem Statement
You are responsible for testing the application hosted at https://graphql.bitquery.io/ide. Assuming the different kinds of testing you are going to perform, create a weekly status report which will demonstrate the current quality status to the stackholders. Your report should include atleast the following:
1) Epic-userstory - status for the features planned.
2) How many stories are released?
3) How many stories are tested and completed as per DOD?
4) Defect status 
5) Plan for next release

Note: You can use needed assumptions on the numbers to showcast.
