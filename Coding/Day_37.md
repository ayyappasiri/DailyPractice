## Learning Goal
Linear and Binary search

### Problem #1
Write a program to find Smallest and second smallest element in an Array.

### Problem #2
Write a program to find Largest and Second Largest element in an Array.

### Problem #3
Find the missing number in an array.

Example:

input1 {7,5,6,1,4,2} and Output: 3

input2 {5,3,1,2} and Output: 4

### Problem #4
Search an element in a rotated and sorted array.

Input {16,19,21,25,3,5,8,10}, To be search = 5

Output : 5 (index of the element)

### Problem #5
Find the minimum element in a sorted and rotated array

Example:

input {16,19,21,25,3,5,8,10};

Output: 3

### Problem #6
Find the number occurring an odd number of times in an array.

Input {20, 40, 50, 40, 50, 20, 30, 30, 50, 20, 40, 40, 20}

Ouptput = 50

### Problem #7
You are given arrival and departure time of trains reaching to a particular station. You need to find minimum number of platforms required to accommodate the trains at any point of time.

For example:
 
arrival {1:00, 1:40, 1:50, 2:00, 2:15, 4:00}

departure {1:10, 3:00, 2:20, 2:30, 3:15, 6:00}

Output: 4
