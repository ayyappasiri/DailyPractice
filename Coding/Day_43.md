### Problem #6
Write a Program to print Floyd’s triangle.

Floyd’s triangle, named after Robert Floyd, is a right angled triangle which is made up using natural numbers. It start from 1 and consecutively selects the next greater number in the sequence.
In the Floyd’s triangle, there are n integers in the nth row and total of (n(n+1))/2 integer in the rows.  
```
1                                                                                                                          
2  3                                                                                                                        
4  5  6                                                                                                                      
7  8  9 10                                                                                                                   
11 12 13 14 15
```
### Problem #7
Write a Program to print Pascal triangle.

Pascal triangle is the set of numbers arranged in the form of triangle.Each number in the row is the sum of the left number and right number on the above row. if a number is missing in the above row, it is assumed to be 0. the first row starts with number 1.
```
