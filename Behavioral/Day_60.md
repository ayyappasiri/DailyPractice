## Learning Goal
Communication

### Problem statement #1
You are leading a diverse team located in say 3 different locations in the world. For simplicity lets assume the following:
- Team A - US Location 
- Team B - India Location 
- Team C - Germany Location

As a leader you are facing the following issues:
1) The 3 teams are working remotely and sync up over calls whenever needed.
2) Teams are able to manage day to day communication using English, but what you could feel that Team B and Team C are more comfortable and productive if they use their respective native langauges for communication.
3) Each team has some unique skills which is a value addition to the overall team goals.
4) There is no unofficial communication/meet ups happening due to remote mode of working and different culturals backgrounds.

Come up with a plan so that you can overcome the above limitations and facilitate the smooth interaction between the above 3 teams and buid a personal bonding between them irrespective of the diverse background each team member is coming from.
