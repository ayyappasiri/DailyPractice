You could see both people as well as process problems in the system. You have tried out differt strategies which you know from your past experience but could not see any improvement after one year of time. The leadership team is not helping you and blaming you uncapable of handling things of your own. 

- Do you consider this as a failure in your career?
- How are you going to come out from this situation?
- Are you going to fight back or quit if things does not improve?
